This project generates synthetic data and tests them on the multiplexing analysis (whole trial, poisson distributed, analysis only).


TO RUN PROJECT: 
-open master_script.R and run from beginning. Options in this script include parameters for data generation as well as types of datasets to generate (matching specific hypotheses/controls described in comments, as well as below). Plotting is done via matlab script, mplx_plotting_master.m, on the final results files (labeled as [hypothesis]_poi.csv in results folder). 

-IMPORTANT NOTE: the initial parameters in master_script.R have been changed to produce only a small sample data set for analysis demonstration (~5 minutes computation time on desktop). In order to reproduce the full analysis (~15 hours computation time on desktop), these values should be returned those noted in commented lines 44-53.  

-Unless wanting to completely rerun all analyses, I recommend editing the master_script to only evaluate the hypotheses of interest, or skipping to plotting via matlab scripts.


DESCRIPTION OF FOLDER CONTENTS:
data: stores data generated by code, for the purposes of testing
results: contains output of poisson analysis as well as plots
src: contains all relevant source code, including both matlab and R files. R files include a copy of the whole trial multiplexing analysis code as well as a custom script for running the code on this particular analysis (experiments_synth.R).
doc: contains working draft (model_vetting_#.docx) as well as various notes taken throughout the project [NOTE: Not included in github repo].
