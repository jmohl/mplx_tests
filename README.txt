This project generates synthetic data and tests it on the multiplexing analysis (whole trial, poisson, analysis only).

TO RUN PROJECT: 
open master_script.R and run from beginning. Options in this script include parameters for data generation as well as types of datasets to generate (matching specific hypotheses/controls described in comments, as well as below). Plotting is done via matlab script, mplx_plotting_master.m, on the final results files (labeled as [hypothesis]_poi.csv in results folder). A full run from scratch takes about 12-15 hours on desktop. 

-Unless wanting to completely rerun all analysis, I recommend editing the master_script to only evaluate the hypothesis of interest, or skipping to plotting via matlab scripts.


DESCRIPTION OF FOLDER CONTENTS:
data: stores data generated by code, for the purposes of testing
results: contains output of poisson analysis as well as plots
src: contains all relevant source code, including both matlab and R files. R files include a copy of the whole trial multiplexing analysis code as well as a custom script for running the code on this particular analysis (experiments_synth.R).
doc: contains working draft (model_vetting_#.docx) as well as various notes taken throughout the project.
