This project generates synthetic data and tests it on the multiplexing analysis (whole trial, poisson, analysis only).

TO RUN PROJECT: open master_script.R and run from beginning. Options in this script include parameters for data generation as well as types of datasets to generate (matching specific hypotheses described in comments). Plotting is done via matlab scripts on the final results files (labeled as [hypothesis]_poi.csv in results folder). 

data: stores data generated by code, for the purposes of testing
results: contains output of poisson analysis as well as plots
src: contains all relevant source code, including both matlab and R files. R files include a copy of the whole trial multiplexing analysis code as well as a custom script for running the code on this particular analysis (experiments_synth.R).
