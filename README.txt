This project generates synthetic data and tests it on the multiplexing analysis (whole trial, poisson, analysis only).

Data: stores data generated by code, for the purposes of testing
src: contains all relevant source code, including both matlab and R files. R files include a copy of the whole trial multiplexing analysis code as well as a custom script for running the code on this particular analysis.
