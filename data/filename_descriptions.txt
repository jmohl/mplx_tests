Testing data set, using poisson distribution.
-These data are fabricated using known poisson distributions in order to test the reliability of various analysis methods.

Description of data:
Alike = All AB trial types are drawn from the same distribution as A trial types
average = AB trials are drawn from a single distribution that is the average of A and B mean rates
wt_average = same as average, except the mean is .75*A + .25 * B
outside = AB trials = 1.2*A rate
switch = AB trials are drawn either from A or B distributions, with 50% probabiity
weak_swich80[90] = same as switch, but the distributions are scaled such that B' = 1.2[1.1]*B and A' = .8[.9]*A
